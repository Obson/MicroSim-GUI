# MicroSim

Note: I have resurrected this project after a gap of about six years. The previous version worked but was very limited. I have not yet update the documenation, which is completely out of date and is best ignored!

**MicroSim** is a micro-economic modelling program designed to complement SimX (which is a *macro*-economic modelling system). Like SimX, it provides its own graphics, but it can also output its results in the form of a CSV file which can be read into a spreadsheet for further analysis or formatting.

### Technicalities ###

MicroSim has been developed using Qt (5.9) and uses Qt Frameworks throughout. The files in this repository include the .pro file so it can easily be cloned as a Qt project in Qt Creator. It is being developed, so far, under Mac OSX, but it should be straightforward to recompile it on any platform supported by Qt.

Please see [the Wiki](https://github.com/Obson/MicroSim-GUI/wiki) for more information.
